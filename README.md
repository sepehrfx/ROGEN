# RoGen
The RoGen project utilizes a genetic algorithm to simulate rockets navigating towards a specific target. These rockets operate in a two-dimensional space, adhering to physics equations for movement control. Through multiple generations, the genetic algorithm evolves a population of rockets. Fit individuals are selected for breeding, passing on their genetic information to the next generation. The project encompasses implementing essential components: a rocket physics engine, target detection system, genetic algorithm, and simulation visualization. The overarching objective is to develop a population of rockets capable of precisely reaching the designated target.
